# Wave Portal
This is a simple web3 / dApp built with guidance from [BuildSpace](https://app.buildspace.so/home) and at last I've added some of my own implementtions to it including the UI.\
The smart contract of this dApp is deployed on Rinkeby test network. [click here to check](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x911c2D38B982D28F920D9C3357776553e13FBd53)\

I've made use of hardhat library 👷‍♂️ to test and deploy 🚀 smart-contracts using Alchemy. While the UI of this dApp is built using React ✨.
